## Purpose of the application– 
The purpose of the application was to design and develope a game  for users who traditionally wouldn't be able to play classic mouse/keyboard games.

In order to complete the project we set out 4 core objectives.
1. Research voice-recognition gesture technolgies.
2. Design a solution.
3. Implement game logic compatable to showcase technolgies.
4. Present the final product.

## Research
### Games of this type
To get a further undertanding of how this technology could be incorporated into a game we conducted research to see how other developers incorporated speech into games. [itch.io](https;// insert link here) published a list of the top voice controlled games available on the windows platform:
1. OneHand Clapping (User humms). 
2. Resonance (howl into glass).
3. ScreamTrain (Just scream).
4. BooGreedykif (user says boo).

After testing and playing these games we discoverd none of them actually use a proper speech/word recognition sound and work off general patterns. This finding showed us a wide gap in the market for a fun, challanging **voice** controlled game.

Our solution to this issue? A unique voice controlled implementation of the classic **Who Wants To Be A Millionaire**.

### The technology
This section will contain information on the research conducted for thye technology.


design of the application including the screens of the user interface and how it works.  The application can be an experimentation process for you, testing how pieces of hardware could interact or be combined with gestures.  You don’t have to solve the world economic crisis just yet.  

## Gestures identified
The game has been configured to be fully functional with just a users voice. Although we did also implement the solution to be fully compatable with mouse input aswell as touch controls so at any time under every circumstance .

## Hardware used in creating the application–
You are not limited to the hardware listed above.  If you have your own hardware, or hardware simulator that you wish to use, then feel free.  The purpose of each piece of hardware should be given with a comparison to other options available.

## Architecture for the solution–
the full architecture for the solution, including the class diagrams, any data models, communications and distributed elements that you are creating.The architecture must make sense when the gestures and the hardware are combined. Justification is necessary in the documentation for this.You need to include a list of relevant libraries that you used in the project.

## Conclusions & Recommendations–
Conclusions are what you have learned from this project and the associated research.  Recommendations are what you would do differently if you were to undertake the project again.  The Reflective Piece–what I learned and “enjoyed”! This gives scope for a critical evaluation of the project and the objective that you tried to achieve
