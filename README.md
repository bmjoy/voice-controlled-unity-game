## Purpose of the application– 
design of the application including the screens of the user interface and how it works.  The application can be an experimentation process for you, testing how pieces of hardware could interact or be combined with gestures.  You don’t have to solve the world economic crisis just yet.  

## Gestures identified
as appropriate for this application–consider how gestures can be incorporated into the application, providinga justificationfor the ones that you pick.  This is an importantresearch element for the project and needs to explain how the gestures fit into the solution you are creating.

## Hardware used in creating the application–
You are not limited to the hardware listed above.  If you have your own hardware, or hardware simulator that you wish to use, then feel free.  The purpose of each piece of hardware should be given with a comparison to other options available.

## Architecture for the solution–
the full architecture for the solution, including the class diagrams, any data models, communications and distributed elements that you are creating.The architecture must make sense when the gestures and the hardware are combined. Justification is necessary in the documentation for this.You need to include a list of relevant libraries that you used in the project.

## Conclusions & Recommendations–
Conclusions are what you have learned from this project and the associated research.  Recommendations are what you would do differently if you were to undertake the project again.  The Reflective Piece–what I learned and “enjoyed”! This gives scope for a critical evaluation of the project and the objective that you tried to achieve
