# Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (Voice-Controlled)
The following repoistory contains the source code and documentation for our voice-controlled implementation of "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"

# Overview
As stated above, the project is essentially a voice-controlled implementation of the classic quiz game "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire". 

The original goal of the project was to develop a game/application using <b>Gesture-Based</b> controls. We choise Voice/Speech recognition as our "<i>gesture</i>".

# Prerequisites

* Windows 10
* Windows Language Packs
* A microphone <b>OR</b> a mouse

# Installation

* Please ensure you have either downloaded/configured the appropriate language packs inside Windows before attempting to play the game. If you're having trouble with this, please follow this [tutorial on configuring Windows Speech Recognition](https://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-speech-recognition-windows-10)

* To actually run the game, clone/download this repository.
* The latest/stable build of the game can be found in the <b>Builds</b> folder in the root directory of the project.

## Purpose of the application– 
The purpose of the application was to design and develope a game  for users who traditionally wouldn't be able to play classic mouse/keyboard games.

In order to complete the project we set out 4 core objectives.
1. Research voice-recognition gesture technolgies.
2. Design a solution.
3. Implement game logic compatable to showcase technolgies.
4. Present the final product.

## Research
### Games of this type
To get a further undertanding of how this technology could be incorporated into a game we conducted research to see how other developers incorporated speech into games. [itch.io](https;// insert link here) published a list of the top voice controlled games available on the windows platform:
1. OneHand Clapping (User humms). 
2. Resonance (howl into glass).
3. ScreamTrain (Just scream).
4. BooGreedykif (user says boo).

After testing and playing these games we discoverd none of them actually use a proper speech/word recognition sound and work off general patterns. This finding showed us a wide gap in the market for a fun, challanging **voice** controlled game.

Our solution to this issue? A unique voice controlled implementation of the classic **Who Wants To Be A Millionaire**.

### The technology
This section will contain information on the research conducted for thye technology.


design of the application including the screens of the user interface and how it works.  The application can be an experimentation process for you, testing how pieces of hardware could interact or be combined with gestures.  You don’t have to solve the world economic crisis just yet.  

## Gestures identified
The game has been configured to be fully functional with just a users voice. Although we did also implement the solution to be fully compatable with mouse input aswell as touch controls so at any time under every circumstance .
